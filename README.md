Project for pretty printing a url
- Enter a domain name to view the information of the domain
- Targets whoisxml api to grab the domain information
- Started as a coding project for a job interview, but I have since worked on it more, creating my own backend

To run:
- Navigate to server and run `npm install` to install packages
- Run `npm start` to start the backend server
- Navigate to the frontend directory
- Run `npm install` to install FE packages
- Run `npm start` to start the frontend
